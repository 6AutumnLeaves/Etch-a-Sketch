# Etch-a-Sketch
<h1>👉🏻<a href="https://6autumnleaves.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/"> Link to Project</a></h1>
My goal with this project is to make a web page that looks like a physical Etch-A-Sketch and works like one as well!<br>
Here are the goals!:<br>
  1) Be able to draw on just the etch a sketch area<br>
  2) Be able to resize the drawing area<br>
  3) Be able to Erase the drawing area<br>
  4) Make the drawing area go from 1x1 to 100x100 pixels<br>
  5) Make the whole project responsive<br>
<br>
We should be able to go up to a 100 by 100 grid
