# Etch-a-Sketch
My goal with this project is to make a web page that looks like a physical Etch-A-Sketch and works like one as well!
Here are the goals!:
  1) Be able to draw on just the etch a sketch area
  2) Be able to resize the drawing area
  3) Be able to Erase the drawing area
  4) Make the drawing area go from 1x1 to 100x100 pixels
  5) Make the whole project responsive

We should be able to go up to a 100 by 100 grid
